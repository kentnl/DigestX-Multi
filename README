DigestX::Multi

"Digest::Many" aims to simplify common work-flows that are necessary
where-ever somebody might wish to compute multiple digests for the same
content, specifically, with care not to need to open the same files for
multiple passes.

The need to do so arises in especially paranoid situations where the
potential concern involves the potential of any one digest algorithm to
be attacked and have a collision built for, based on the notion that
finding one collision for a given algorithm is hard enough, but it aught
to be many orders of magnitude more difficult to generate a collision
that simultaneously collides under two or more algorithms.

Thus, increasing the number of digest algorithms used exponentially
hardens your attack surface, slightly more so than increasing the digest
size of a single algorithm would achieve.

However, this makes the data less useful for applications where a digest
is used to hide/validate some data using a shared secret, as re-using
the same shared secret with the same content under multiple digests
slightly increases the total number of bits that may relate to the
secret, and increases the chance that the secret may be obtained by
breaking a favourable algorithm.
